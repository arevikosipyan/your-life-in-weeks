# The CS50P Final Project
for CS50's Introduction to Programming with Python <br>
by Akbar Gafurov & Arevik Osipyan

## Description
For our project in *CS50's Introduction to Programming with Python* course, we designed a visualizer app that helps users reflect on how many weeks they have lived for and how many they have left â€“ based on the average life expectancy in their country. Using our Python skills, we created multiple helper functions to prompt the user for personal information, load and extract life expectancy by country or continent, and visually represent lived weeks using a grid of squares.

Our project follows a functional programming approach and makes efficient use of modules and packages such as csv and Pillow. Every function and code block is thoroughly documented to help future programmers understand the program's structure and potentially reuse or build upon it. This final project not only showcases our proficiency in designing and developing Python programs but also highlights our attention to detail and commitment to continued learning.
